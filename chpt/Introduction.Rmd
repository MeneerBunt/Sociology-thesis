Climate change urge national and local governments to make policy’s to enable energy transition from fossil energy sources that are free from emitting carbon in the atmosphere[@klimaat_2019]. Governments hold differed tactics in pushing society towards a sustainable future, such as 1) punishing bad behavior. 2) rewarding good behavior, 3) use social influence or norms to influence public opinion and 4) persuasion by marked stimuli [@salazar_2012]. The Dutch municipalities have chosen the last option. Via a web of subsidies citizens are persuaded to invest in sustainable technology[@energiesubsidiewijzer]. Question arises: _What publics are not addressed in the persuasive tactics of the government to push energy transition via marked stimuli?_ The aim of this article is evaluate this policy by investigating in what areas in the Dutch society are not infiltrated by new sustainable technology. Thereby this research adds a new perspective on the Dutch energy transition, since it is investigating what groups in the Dutch society are not adopting to energy solutions to prevent climate change.

The topic is already investigated in a opposite direction, and concluded that the annual income of the household end the peer-effects are the best predictors in prediction the adaptation of  new sustainable technology. There are qualitative articles investigating the discursive trends in post-foundational democracy in transition management [@jhagroe_2015], but no quantitative analysis is done on the mutual characteristics of people that are not transitioning their energy consumption to sustainable sources. 
 A difficult factor in this research, is the "Naive Psychology" in investigating the peer-effect of the spread of sustainable technology, since people seems unable to detect the effect of normative social influence. In many cases, people underestimate the effect that the norms of their peers. 
 
Much research is contributed to explaining the diffusion of innovation [ToDo Spatial diffusion of innovation], as well as the diffusion of sustainable technology’s by households[@hyysalo_2015; @salazar_2012].
