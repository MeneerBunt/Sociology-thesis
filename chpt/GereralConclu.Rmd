# General conclusion
@jasanoff_kim_2015 argue that the collective imagination of the desired future shapes the development of technology. Therefore, this thesis investigated the imaginaries of non-adopters of ECO-innovation via a mix-method study. The study identifies three imaginaries: collective action imaginary, systemic change imaginary and (temporary) crisis imaginary. No evidence was found for the apocalypse imaginary, as identified by @levy_spicer_2013. None of the non-adoptors of ECO-innovation in this inquiry expressed that they were opposed to taking measures to prevent climate change, but imagined other ways of accomplishing a transition to a sustainable climate. Also, this study concludes that there are different perspectives on the speed with which the sustainability challenge oughts to be completed. In identifying imaginaries that prevents people from adopting ECO-innovation, three imaginaries are identified: collective action, systemic change, and (temporary) crisis. A summary of these imaginaries is portrayed in figure \@ref(fig:climNiew). The figure shows two axes. 
The horizontal axis, derived from @levy_spicer_2013 (see theory section), is about the way a person views the stability of the climate. Respondents that envisioned the climate as resilient imagined the earth able to correct itself,  and thereby, climate change is not fundamentally challenging life on earth. On the opposite side is the depiction of a fragile climate. In this group, this thesis identifies two imaginaries of non-adopters. The difference of the imaginaries are on the way the government needs to act in the effort to prevent climate change, as depicted on the vertical axis of figure \@ref(fig:climNiew). Together, this imaginaries will shape the energy transition.

 While the Dutch government uses neo-liberal marked principles to seduce residents into adopting ECO-innovation, imaginaries in this group depict other ways to a sustainable future. In this study, there is a group that imagines that measures need to be taken to prevent climate change from happening but is opposed to the way the Dutch government is taking measures. One of these depictions is the conversion to a sustainable environment via well-fare principles. In this imaginary, respondents expected the government to take control, e.g., installing PV. Another group thinks that the government needs to address the issue to large companies. At the moment, nature does not have a price, and thereby, capitalists can exploit it to gain profit. In the systemic change imaginary, the system in which we live needs to change in order to prevent this from proceeding. The problem with this imaginary is, is that it is hard to imagine another system that the capitalistic. "It is easier to imagine an end to the world than an end to capitalism" [@fisher_2009]. The systemic change imaginary is a call for change, without clear ways of how this change ought to happen.
