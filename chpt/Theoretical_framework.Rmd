# Theoretical framework
To investigate the sociotechnical imaginaries of the people that are not adopting innovation, this article explores the normative framework of persons from this group concerning sustainability. This chapter explains what we mean when we talk about imaginaries, the diffusion of ECO-innovation and social-influence. 

## Sociotechnical energy imaginaries
Imaginaries describe the way people imagine their social surroundings and is made visible in images, stories, and legends, necessary for common understanding of practices and a widely shared sense of legitimacy of things like borders and nationalities [@taylor_2004]. These shared understandings are embedded in social practices that shape the future trough the development of e.g. norms, policies and technology. Before shooting into space it is first the imagination dreaming about it [@Jasanoff_kim_2009]. Methods to investigate the role of imaginaries in the production of technology are conceptualized in the interpretive framework of CO-production by Jasanoff and Kim [-@jasanoff_kim_2015], and argues that the interpretation of knowledge depends on the interest of society.  Though they can originate in the visions of single individuals, sociotechnical imaginaries are collectively held by making the vision public and brings together the normativity of the imagination with the materiality of networks in the production on technological [energy] projects. Adaptation of new technology is thereby not merely a matter of ability, but also a matter of vision. In the adaptation of PV, this vision is further complicated by the depiction of the climate.
Levy and Spices [-@levy_spicer_2013] convincingly derive differed imaginaries from observation and analysis of the various framings of the climate actors and the media on sustainability. These four core imaginaries they identify are the 1) 'fossil fuels forever': this (obsolete) popular imaginary viewed abundant cheap fossil fuel as the prime motor behind a competitive industrialization. 2) the 'climate apocalypse' imaginary paints an alarming picture of the coming decades, visible in movies like 'day after tomorrow' [-@DAT]. The article of Cook [-@Cook_2018] shows that people that hold this imaginary see change as inevitable, attempts to avoid it is useless. 3) 'techno-market' is the combination of capitalism and sustainability. In this view, the marked provides new product that enable a life as consumers in sustainable way's. Cook [-@Cook_2018] also identifies a technology imaginary where people see a future where new technology’s will provide a solution of the climate crisis e.g. building vertical tubes in the ocean to help the ecosystem cure itself by increase the mixing of nutrient-rich with the relatively barren waters at the ocean surface. [@Buisding] 4) 'Sustainable lifestyle': these movements are inspired by an simpler and less materialistic lifestyle. In this view, solar does not necessarily needs to be adopted to reduce the production of CO2.

The common practices from the climate imaginaries creates new imaginaries. 

## Diffusion of ECO-innovation

According to @rogers_1983, the adoption of the innovations depends on the perceived relative advantage of innovation, the complexity of the innovation, the social influence, and requied knowledge and costs. In this article, the spread of a new technology in a society is conceptualized by the process of diffusion of innovation, 'the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.' [@rogers_1983, p. 5].
<!--Innovation is the new product or idea. -->In this study, the focus is on ECO-innovations. ECO-innovations are about  new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts [@James_1997]. This combination of reducing carbon emission and provide economic opportunity’s, which is also the way the energy transition is described in the klimaatakkoord [@klimaat_2019].
<!--Communication is the process of sharing new information to people that have not adopted the innovation. -->
A communication channel is the means by which messages get from one individual to another, that can be things like media or personal relations. The strength of the ties an individual maintains with a communicator of an innovation influence the change of a successful adoption. Time is involved in diffusion through the process which an individual passes from first knowledge of an innovation to forming an attitude toward the innovation, to a decision to adopt or reject, to implementation of the new idea, and to confirm this decision towards the rest of the world. Thereby the time that it takes to spread an innovation in a social system is key in this research. The innovation is distributed in a social system. There are differed types of social networks, this article focused on residential spatial networks. Rogers [-@rogers_1983] classified the categories of the adopters as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards, and an innovation is spread through a network in the respective order. This diffution of innovation theory leads us to conclude that the diffusion of ECO-innovation follows a visible spatial path from innovators to the majority in an local network trough, in which the strength of the relations influences the speed of adoption.

## (Undetected) Social influence
Individuals in society do not act as independent decision-making units, but their behavior is influenced by the other members of the reference group [@salazar_2012], defining social influence as the change in an individual's attitude or behavior that results from the interaction" with other individuals or social group. @salazar_2012 studies the social in fluence that peer groups like colleagues, family and friends may have on sustainable consumption. They find evidence for 'herd behavior' (imitations of others) and for 'social learning' (learning via network). @schultz_2008 also investigated the persuasive impact of normative social influence. Additionally, they also studied the detectability of this social influence. In the study, despite the fact that participants had the least impact on their own energy conservation, the results showed that the descriptive norms had an impact on the environment, that is socially responsible, or even saving money. This "naive psychology-based" beliefs about energy conservation were inaccurate predictors of actual energy conservation. This gives problems in predicting the diffusion of ECO innovations, since peoples motivation for adoption is less rational than they believe themselves. In this article, the focus is on the normative frameworks on an emergent level. The aim is to investigate how the individual believes fit in the social context of the individual. From this emergent pattern we try to gain knowledge about why people are not adopting ECO innovations.
