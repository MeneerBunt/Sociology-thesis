# Theoretical framework: Social aspects of innovation
To investigate the sociotechnical energy imaginaries of the people that are not adopting sustainable innovation, this article explores the normative framework of people from this group concerning sustainability. This chapter provides theories on imaginaries, the diffusion of ECO-innovation, and social influence. 

## Sociotechnical energy imaginaries \label{TheoImag}
Imaginaries describe the way people imagine their social surroundings and are made visible in images, stories, and legends, necessary for a common understanding of practices and a widely shared sense of legitimacy of things like borders and nationalities [@taylor_2004]. These shared understandings are embedded in social practices that shape the future through the development of, e.g., norms, policies, and technology. Before shooting into space, it is first the imagination dreaming about it [@Jasanoff_kim_2009]. Methods to investigate the role of imaginaries in the production of technology are conceptualized in the interpretive framework of CO-production by @jasanoff_kim_2015 and argues that the interpretation of knowledge depends on the interest of society.  Though they can originate in the visions of single individuals, sociotechnical imaginaries are collectively held by making the images public and brings together the normativity of the imagination with the materiality of networks in the production on technological (energy) projects. Adaptation of new technology is thereby not merely a matter of ability, but also a matter of vision. In the adaptation of PV, the public image is complicated by the depiction of the climate. Levy and Spices [-@levy_spicer_2013] convincingly derive differed imaginaries from observation and analysis of the various framings of the climate actors and the media on sustainability. These four core imaginaries they identify are the 1) 'fossil fuels forever': this (obsolete) popular imaginary viewed abundant cheap fossil fuel as the prime motor behind competitive industrialization. 2) the 'climate apocalypse' imaginary paints an alarming picture of the coming decades, visible in movies like 'day after tomorrow' [-@DAT]. The article of @Cook_2018 shows that people that hold this imaginary see change as inevitable and attempts to avoid it are useless. 3) 'techno-market' is the combination of capitalism and sustainability. In this view, the marked provides a new product that enables life as consumers in a sustainable way's. Cook [-@Cook_2018] also identifies a technology imaginary where people see a future where new technologies will provide a solution of the climate crisis, e.g., building vertical tubes in the ocean to help the ecosystem cure itself by increasing the mixing of nutrient-rich with the relatively barren waters at the ocean surface [@Buisding]. 4) 'Sustainable lifestyle': less materialistic lifestyle inspires these movements to lower the environmental impact; no additional assets are needed to achieve this goal. In this view, solar does not necessarily need to be adopted to reduce the production of CO2. The four imaginaries are plotted on to axes by @levy_spicer_2013, as shown in figure \@ref(fig:clim). Another way to look at the concept of "resilient- or fragile climate," is the stable-climate perspective as described by @lovelock_2014. Imagining the earth chemistry as stable, tels people that there is still time to fix the issue. The problem, however, is that the climate on earth is fundamentally unstable. A chemical unbalance is the premise for life; all the planets that are chemical balanced, are dead planets like Mars [@lovelock_2014]. Thereby, the concept of a stable-climate is misleading since a stable climate is a dead planet in this definition.

New technologies spread in society by the process of innovation diffusion. This adoption process depends on the perceived relative advantage, the complexity of implementation, the social influence, and required knowledge and costs [@rogers_1983]. The spread of new technology in society is conceptualized as "the (diffusion) process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system" [@rogers_1983, p. 5]. In this study, the focus is on ECO-innovations; new products and processes which provide customer and business value but significantly decrease environmental impacts [@James_1997]. This combination of reducing carbon emission and provide economic opportunities is also the way the energy transition is described in the klimaatakkoord [@klimaat_2019]. Innovation is communicated from individual to another via channels, that can be things like media or personal relations. The strength of the ties an individual maintains with a communicator of an innovation influences the change of successful adoption. Time is involved in the speeds that communication "passes from first knowledge of an innovation to forming an attitude toward the innovation, to a decision to adopt or reject, to the implementation of the new idea, and to confirm this decision towards the rest of the world" [@rogers_1983, p. 36].  Thereby the time that it takes to spread innovation in a social system is relevant in this research. The innovation is distributed in a social system. There are differed types of social networks, and this thesis focused on private residential spatial networks. @rogers_1983 classified the categories of the adopters as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards, and innovation is spread through a network in the respective order. This diffusion of innovation theory leads to conclude that the diffusion of ECO-innovation follows a visible spatial path from innovators to the majority in a local network trough, in which the strength of the relations influences the speed of adoption. From this innovation theory, this article uses five steps in the adoption process of innovation: 1) knowledge about the system and the climate problem, 2) persuasion factors via the communication channels, 3) way of decision making, 4) implementation, and 5) confirmation. In the interviews in part two of this study, these steps are used as topics in the interviews.

## (Undetected) Social influence
Individuals in society do not act as independent decision-making units, but their behavior is influenced by the other members of the reference group [@salazar_2012], defining social influence as the change in an individual's attitude or behavior that results from the interaction with other individuals or social group. @salazar_2012 studied the social influence that peer groups like colleagues, family, and friends may have on sustainable consumption. They find evidence for "herd behavior" (imitations of others) and for "social learning" (learning via network). @schultz_2008  studied the detectability of this social influence. In the study, even though participants expressed that the social norms of others did not influence their energy conservation, the results show a high correlation between the descriptive norms of the network and those of the participants self. The false perception that people have of social influence leaves the researchers to conclude that "naive psychology-based" beliefs about energy conservation were inaccurate predictors of actual energy conservation. Social influence gives problems in predicting the diffusion of ECO-innovations since peoples motivation for adoption is less rational than they believe themselves. In this article, the focus is on the normative frameworks on an emergent level. The aim is to investigate how the individual believes fit in the social context of the individual. From these emergent patterns, we try to gain knowledge about why people are not adopting ECO innovations.
