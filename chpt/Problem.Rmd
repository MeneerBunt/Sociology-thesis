# Problem statement: Imaginaries of non-adoptors
The (potential) disruptive effect that the energy transition has on the Dutch society creates a needs to precisely identify and understand the precarious publics that are - by not adopting â€“ targeted by the process of innovating to a carbon-neutral society. According to Rogers, late adopters are stereotypically perceived as being traditional, uneducated, resistant to change, low economic resources, and that may become a self-fulfilling prophecy [@rogers_1983, p. 107; @merton_1995]. A division of adopters vs. not adopters of new sustainable energy technology made merely on the availability of resources of willingness to change neglects other motivations [@Wyatt_2003]. This reasoning ignores the fact that technological innovation is always an interplay between material and social landscapes [@jasanoff_kim_2015]. Due to both the risk and uncertainty of climate change, people use different discourses to depict the future [@Cook_2018]. This process, which Jasanoff calls "co-production," is about how knowledge about the world is inseparable from how we choose to live in it [-@jasanoff_2004]. The adoption of innovation is, in that manner, influenced by personal and public visions of the desirable future in terms of social practices, identities, norms, and instruments. These imaginaries are diverse, and thereby, both innovators and non-innovators are divided into various publics for innovation discourse. 
Regardless of the belief about climate change, individual adoption of technology cannot be normalized by society. Sociotechnical energy imaginaries shape the future of the transition to a sustainable future, understanding this imaginaries for the non-adopters is key in understanding why this group is not innovating.

The real decision making for the investment in ECO-innovation is an interplay between the natural resources and the social world of the adopter. The effects this interplay has on the possibility of a household (not) to invest in sustainable innovations will be investigated in this article. Only the investigation of the interplay between these concepts will create an understanding of why household are not adopting new technology. This understanding makes possible public issues in the transition to sustainable energy visible and can thereby help in creating a more inclusive framework for transitions. The conceptual model is shown in figure \@ref(fig:Conspt). Built from the findings from Rogers that non-adopters are not just opposing to change, but can experience real boundaries in adopting an innovation [@rogers_1983], the research question in this thesis is the following:

_How do sociotechnical energy imaginaries, like "fossil fuels forever" or "sustainable future," shape the adoption of ECO-innovation by households in Dutch society?_

This thesis is conducted in two parts. Part one is about finding indicators to predict (none)adoption, by an empirical study of the distribution of ECO-innovations in Dutch neighborhoods. These parameters were used to select research areas for the second part of this study. Part two of the study is about identifying the energy imaginaries of people that are not adopting ECO-innovation. The imaginaries from this group are studied via interviews with people that match the indicators for adoption (part one) but are nevertheless not adopting PV. This strategy assumes that the non-adopters call on imaginaries that make them resistant or reluctant towards ECO-innovation. Together these studies help to understand why people are not adopting ECO-innovation and evaluate if the struggles for sustainability are (re)making urban spaces [@Jhagroe_2016].
